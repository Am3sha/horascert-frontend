                    The International Accreditation Forum, commonly known as the IAF, is a global alliance of accreditation bodies and related entities engaged in conformity assessment activities. Its primary objective is to promote international trade by promoting the development of a uniform conformity assessment system at the international level.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    The core of IAF’s activities is to develop and maintain a set of globally recognized standards for accreditation bodies and conformity assessment processes. These standards are embodied in the IAF Multilateral Recognition Agreement (IAF MLA).
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    Furthermore, IAF serves as a central platform for its members to exchange ideas, best practices and engage in collaborative efforts to enhance the quality and efficiency of conformity assessment activities. IAF is recognized by many international bodies, including the World Trade Organization (WTO), as the pre-eminent authority in the field of accreditation.
