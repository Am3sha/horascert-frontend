                    <li>
                        If there is any violation of the proposal or registration application or the general conditions for the certification of the system, product and service or these Codes of Practice or the regulations governing the use of the certification mark.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the products are placed on the market in an unsafe or non-conforming condition.</li>

                <p className="paragraph">
                    HORAS-Cert will confirm in writing to the customer the suspension of the certification.

                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">
                    When these conditions are met, the suspension will be lifted and the customer will be notified of the reactivation of the certification. If the conditions are not met, the certification will be withdrawn.
                </p>
                <p className="paragraph">The Client shall bear all costs incurred by HORAS-Cert in suspending and reactivating the certificate.</p>
